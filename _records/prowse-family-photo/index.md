This image was added to the archive by Mervyn Powell in 2009. According to Mervyn the figures in the image are:

James PROWSE (5 October 1861 - 30 April 1935) and his wife Mary Elizabeth PROWSE (nee HAMBLEY at Chagford, 7 Sept 1862 - 1946 ?????).  My mother in law tells me that Mary remarried about 3 yrs after James' death, to man named WALSH or WELSH, but I cannot find it in the GRO index of marriages, but there is a marriage to a WALLIS, but it is at Penzance.  Mr WELSH, WALSH or whatever died about 3 or 4 yrs later and Mary Elizabeth survived until about 1946.  I understand that she is buried with James 'just over the wall in the churchyard or cemetery'.
