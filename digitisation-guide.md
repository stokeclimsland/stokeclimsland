- The site is hosted by a firm called [Github](http://pages.github.com)*. We use software called 'Jekyll' which converts plain text and markdown to html, suitable for viewing on the web.

- Although it doesn't use a database (which keeps the cost and complexity of the system very low), Jekyll does allow for cross-linking between 'index cards' and 'records'. Some rules apply however, and some discipline is needed in the naming and organisation of files, images and other resources to ensure the site functions properly:

The site is organised into three main types of things:

- An 'index card' is a single markdown file which contains a term from the old paper index, plus a description of the nature of the material held in the archive on that topic, plus links to specific records.

- A 'record' is a folder which contains a collection of markdown files, images and other documents which have been digitised or acquired by the archive.


- A 'post' is a blog post, similar to an announcement or post on a social media site. It doesn't form part of the main archive, but might be used to highlight new materials which are added, or to thank contributors (which might itself be an interesting record in the future).




#### File formats

- All text content should be added in 'markdown' format, which is a simple text format that can be converted to html, word documents etc. Markdown is a good archival format because plain text will always be readable on future computer systems, but it retains the ability to add formatting information and links. A guide to using markdown can be found here XXX, although simply adding text to the page should be self explanatory. Markdown files have the extension '.md' or '.markdown' and can be created in even the most basic text editor (e.g. NotePad on Windows).

- All images should be stored in both their original format and size, and as smaller .jpg or .png images suitbale for viewing online. 




\* It might seem too good to be true, but Github is a large tech company which views hosting small websites for organisations as both a philanthropic activity and on which supports their main business. Hosting the site there is likely to remain free forever, but the nature of the open formats used means the site could easily be moved to a new home if the need arose.
